The RFID-based Door Lock System is an innovative and secure solution designed to 
address the growing need for enhanced access control and security in various settings, such as 
homes, offices, and industrial facilities. This project aims to provide a convenient and reliable way 
to manage access to restricted areas while minimizing the risks associated with traditional lock 
and key systems. The need for this project arises from the limitations of conventional lock and key 
systems, which are susceptible to unauthorized access through lost or duplicated keys. In contrast, 
the RFID-based Door Lock System leverages Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology 
to offer a more robust and user-friendly access control mechanism. Users are provided with RFID 
cards or key fobs, each embedded with a unique identification code. When a user presents their 
RFID card or key fob to the reader, the system authenticates their identity and grants or denies 
access accordingly. This project provides an overview of the RFID-based Door Lock System's 
components, including RFID readers, RFID cards/key fobs, a microcontroller, and an electric door 
lock mechanism. The system's operation is explored, detailing the communication between the 
RFID reader and the microcontroller. Additionally, the project demonstrates the integration of a 
mobile application for remote access control and monitoring. The RFID-based Door Lock System 
offers several advantages, such as improved security, real-time access logs, and the ability to 
manage access permissions remotely. This project not only addresses the need for enhanced 
security but also showcases the potential for the widespread adoption of RFID technology in access 
control systems. By implementing this system, users can enjoy a more secure and convenient way 
to control access to their premises.

## Objectives
- **Enhanced Security:** Implement a secure access control system to prevent 
unauthorized entry into homes, offices, or other restricted areas, reducing the risk 
of theft or intrusion.
- **Convenience:** Provide a user-friendly and convenient method for authorized 
personnel to gain access without the need for traditional keys, which can be lost or 
duplicated.
- **Real-Time Access Control:** Enable real-time monitoring and control of access 
permissions, allowing administrators to grant or revoke access remotely and receive 
notifications of entry events.
- **Integration of RFID Technology:** Incorporate RFID technology to enable quick 
and contactless authentication, enhancing the speed and efficiency of the access 
control process.
- **Arduino Microcontroller Integration:** Utilize Arduino microcontrollers to 
interface with RFID readers and electric door lock mechanisms, creating a costeffective and customizable solution.
- **Mobile Application Integration:** Develop a mobile application that enables users 
to control and monitor access remotely, providing added convenience and 
flexibility.
- **Access Logging:** Implement a logging system that records access events, including 
timestamps and user identification, for security and audit purposes.
- **Customizable Access Permissions:** Allow administrators to define and customize 
access permissions for individual users or groups, providing flexibility in managing 
access rights.
- **Low Maintenance:** Design a system that requires minimal maintenance and is 
reliable for extended periods, reducing operational costs.
